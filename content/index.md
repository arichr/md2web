# Testing area
```
from typing import Iterator

# This is an example
class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def fib(n: int) -> Iterator[int]:
        """ Fibonacci series up to n """
        a, b = 0, 1
        while a < n:
            yield a
            a, b = b, a + b

result = sum(Math.fib(42))
print("The answer is {}".format(result))
```
